CentaurBucks is the world's most mediocre coffee shop. This is its POS software used by baristas around the globe
to help the totally real slew of people wanting their cuppa content.

## Acknowledgements
CentaurBucks is not real. Shame on you for thinking it was. This repository is licensed under the WTFPL and a copy of it
can be found in `/License`.

This POS software was made for a CISC class at my college. I will not be re-writing everything I work on to Java. This
is not a Rustacean invasion.
